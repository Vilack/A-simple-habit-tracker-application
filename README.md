# 🧠 AI-Powered Habit Tracker

This is a simple and smart **Habit Tracker** application built using **Python**, **Tkinter** (for the user interface), and **MySQL** (to store your data). It even uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to predict whether you're likely to stick to your habits based on your tracking history!

## 🚀 Features

1) ✅ Add a Habit
You can type in any habit you'd like to track — like "Exercise", "Read a Book", or "Drink Water" — and save it to your personal habit list.

2) 🎯 Mark Habit as Completed
Whenever you complete a habit for the day, just select it and click **"Mark as Completed"**. The app saves today's date to your habit history.

3) 🔮 Predict Habit Success (Powered by AI)
Curious how well you're doing? Click **"Predict Habit Success"** and the app will tell you — based on your past performance — whether you're likely to stick with your habit or need some motivation!

🛠 How It Works (Beginner-Friendly)

💾 1. Storing Your Habits
- All your habits and their progress are stored in a **MySQL database**.
- Each habit has:
  - A **name** (like "Exercise")
  - A **history** of dates when you completed it.

🧠 2. AI That Learns From You
- Every time you complete a habit, the app keeps count.
- It checks how often you've completed it over time.
- If you've done it often (60% or more in recent entries), the AI says you're likely to **succeed**. Otherwise, it reminds you to **stay motivated**.

🖥 3. Easy-To-Use Interface
The app uses **Tkinter** to show buttons, boxes, and messages — so everything works with clicks and typing. No coding skills needed!
